# ‚öôÔ∏è Universal Configs Manager

`UCM` quickly switches multiple dev configs with a single command.

(_Git config, Node version, Node repository, environment variables, etc._)

## üòÆ How it works
If you work on different projects requiring different environment you can change **all** of your settings with a single CLI command.

Like that:

```
> ucm ls
Universal Configs Manager:
  - personal
  - work     <= current

> ucm
Configured [work]:
  - Git config
    - user.email: my@work.email
  - Node version:    10.2.1
  - Node Repository:  work => https://registry.work.example.com/
  - Environment variables:
    - HTTP_PROXY: http://proxy.work.example.com

> ucm use --name personal
Configured [personal]:
  - Git config
    - user.email: my@personal.email
  - Node version:    15.6.1
  - Node Repository:  npm => https://registry.npmjs.org/
  - Environment variables:
    - HTTP_PROXY: (none)
```

There is a dedicated page about [available command](commands/README.md).

### Pitfalls & known issues

- **Environment variables** &mdash; Originally it was planned to perform changing of env vars in a shell the UMC has been run.
  Unfortunately it does not look to be possible
  without [gdb](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6631034/1975086) [hack](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61801422/1975086)
  and this seems to be too difficult, dangerous & unstable.
  As an alternative we can output to console a script for setting env vars that user should copy-paste and execute manually.
  This is not ideal but still good enough as information is easily available & quick to use.

## üì¶ Supports out of the box

- Environment variables
- Git configuration
- NVM - Node Version Manager
- NRM - Node Repository Manager

Ideas & contributions are welcome on how to make it expandable.

## üì§ Shared config profiles
A named configs profile can point to a file in a shared folder or URL.
This way you can share configuration with your team.
```
 > umc add --url https://example.com/my-team/.ucm.prod.yaml --name work-prod
 > umc add --path //shared_folder/.ucm.test.yaml --name work-test --sync auto
```
### üîõ Sync options
- `ask` - ask to update if changed (_default_)
- `auto` - auto update if changed
- `none` - do not check for updates

### Can take setting from a file
Can apply settings stored inside your project in a `.universal-configs.yaml` file.
```
~/projects/> ucm use --file ./some-project/.universal-configs.yaml
Configured [work]:
  - Git config
    - user.email: my@work.email
Configured [~/projets/some-project/.universal-configs.yaml]:
  - Node version:    10.2.1
  - Node Repository:  work => https://registry.work.example.com/
  - Environment variables:
    - HTTP_PROXY: http://proxy.work.example.com
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Compare config differences
```
> ucm diff --file http://example.com/some-company.yaml --name personal
Compared:
  - File:  http://example.com/some-company.yaml
  - Named: personal
